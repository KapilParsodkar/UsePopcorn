I've successfully developed the UsePopcorn app using React, a dynamic platform reminiscent of IMDb. This user-friendly application allows individuals to effortlessly add movies to their watchlists and rate them. Through the seamless integration of ReactJS, users can navigate through the app with ease, creating a personalized cinematic experience. UsePopcorn is more than just a movie catalog; it's a responsive and interactive project that brings the joy of curation and rating to the forefront, making it an exciting venture for film enthusiasts exploring the world of React development.![App view 1](https://github.com/kapilparsodkar/UsePopcorn/assets/95988187/423adc05-e667-46bf-8049-6554f3fd5517)
